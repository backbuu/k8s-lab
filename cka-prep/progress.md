## Weak-area backlog (re-test until green)
- **RBAC `apiGroups` values** — must be the literal group string (`""` core, `apps`, `batch`),
  confirm with `k explain <res>` (first line). Invented/descriptive values silently grant nothing.
- **RoleBinding → ClusterRole pattern** — the per-namespace reuse of a ClusterRole; reach for
  `--clusterrole=` + `-n <ns>` when a task says "only in namespace X".
- **Extend vs. widen** — adding verbs to an existing rule ≠ adding a new rule; re-read the task's
  verb list against the Role before declaring done.
- **Subject precision** — `system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>`; verify the exact SA, not a lookalike.
- kubeadm `init`/`join` mechanics — kind can't drill these; need Linux VMs before Day 3/Day 4.

## Daily log

> Copy the template below for each new day. Newest at the top.
> **Re-runs are appended as `Day NN.01`, `Day NN.02` — never overwrite a past entry.** (See `CLAUDE.md`.)

### Day NN[.RR] — YYYY-MM-DD — <topic> (Domain <n>)
- **Deliverable:** <the artifact committed today — note / exercise set / project increment>
- **Studied:** <what was covered> → `notes/NN_topic.md`
- **Drilled:** `exercises/NN_topic/` — <count> tasks, timed <mm:ss>
- **Milestone test:** <score>%  → 🟩 / 🟨 (green needs ≥ 80%)
- **Missed / weak:** <list; add to backlog above>
- **Since last attempt:** <re-runs only: what changed, which weak areas are now green>
- **Tomorrow:** <next topic>

### Day 02 — 2026-07-15 — RBAC: SA / Role / Binding / `can-i` (Domain 1)
- **Deliverable:** `notes/02_rbac.md` + `exercises/02_rbac/` (tasks + solutions); least-privilege
  grants built and verified on the kind cluster.
- **Studied:** Role vs ClusterRole vs the two binding types, `system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>`,
  impersonation with `--as=`, apiGroups → `notes/02_rbac.md`
- **Drilled:** `exercises/02_rbac/` — 6 tasks
- **Milestone test:** 67% (4/6) → 🟨 (green needs ≥ 80%) — **re-test required**
- **Missed / weak:**
  - **Task 3** — widened the `pods` rule instead of adding a `deployments` rule; invented an
    apiGroup (`deployment role` instead of `apps`); shipped an incomplete verb list. Three
    corrections needed. This is the dangerous failure mode: it *looks* applied but grants nothing.
  - **Task 5** — needed the RoleBinding→ClusterRole pattern handed over, then bound the wrong
    subject (`default:pod-viewer` vs `prod:prod-viewer`).
  - Strong: cluster-scoped reasoning (Task 4) and reading `can-i --list` output correctly (Task 6).
- **Tomorrow:** **Day 02.01** — RBAC re-test (fresh drill, strict 15 min; must clear the four
  backlog items above) → then Day 3 — etcd backup & restore. Day 3/4 need real kubeadm VMs;
  kind cannot do them.
- **Lab state:** cleaned 2026-07-15 (ns `dev`/`prod`, ClusterRoles `node-reader`/`pod-viewer`,
  CRB `node-bot-binding`, SA `node-bot` all deleted); cluster healthy, 3 nodes Ready.

### Day 01.01 — 2026-07-14 — kubeadm cluster bring-up (Domain 1) — **re-run**
- **Deliverable:** kind cluster torn down and rebuilt from scratch; `notes/01_kubeadm_bringup.md`
  + `exercises/01_kubeadm_bringup/` regenerated.
- **Studied:** Same material as Day 01 (learner-requested clean re-run, not a remediation).
- **Drilled:** `exercises/01_kubeadm_bringup/` — 5 tasks
- **Milestone test:** 100% → 🟩 (5/5, same task set)
- **Since last attempt:** Identical 5/5 result on a fresh cluster — bring-up + component knowledge
  is repeatable, not first-time luck. No new weak areas. The Linux-VM gap below is unchanged
  (it's an environment limit, not a knowledge gap, so a re-run can't clear it).
- **Tomorrow:** Day 2 — RBAC: SA/Role/Binding, `kubectl auth can-i`.

---

### Day 01 — 2026-07-14 — kubeadm cluster bring-up + control-plane components (Domain 1)
- **Deliverable:** 3-node kind cluster (`cka-prep`) up and Ready; static pod manifests inspected.
- **Studied:** kubeadm init/join flow, static pods vs DaemonSets, control-plane vs worker
  components → `notes/01_kubeadm_bringup.md`
- **Drilled:** `exercises/01_kubeadm_bringup/` — 5 tasks, timed
- **Milestone test:** 100% → 🟩 (5/5: static pod manifests, apiserver flag inspection,
  scheduler-down/up failure sim, kubeadm join generation, component placement explanation)
- **Missed / weak:** kind can't drill real `kubeadm init`/`join` mechanics — need Linux VMs
  before Day 3 (etcd backup/restore) and Day 4 (cluster upgrade).
- **Tomorrow:** Day 2 — RBAC: SA/Role/Binding, `kubectl auth can-i`.

---

### Day 00 — 2026-07-14 — Setup
- **Deliverable:** `cka-prep/` scaffold created (CLAUDE.md, goal, map, sources, progress, plan).
- **Studied:** Reviewed the CKA blueprint & domain weights in `01_map.md`.
- **Drilled:** —
- **Milestone test:** N/A (setup day)
- **Missed / weak:** —
- **Tomorrow:** Day 1 — Domain 1: kubeadm cluster bring-up + RBAC basics.
